    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h4>Effective Date: January 1, 2024</h4>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

Welcome to <b>Skillify</b>, where your trust is our priority. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring transparency in how your personal information is collected, used, and shared. This Privacy Policy explains the types of information we collect from you when you access or use our platform, which provides services like selling courses, registering tutors, and facilitating online education. It also outlines how we handle your data and the steps we take to protect it. By accessing our platform, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, we advise you to discontinue the use of our services.

<h3>Information We Collect</h3>

We collect a variety of information to enhance your experience on our platform. The information we collect includes personal data you provide during account creation, transactional data when purchasing or selling courses, and technical data automatically collected through your interaction with our platform.

When you register an account, we collect your name, email address, phone number, and password to create and manage your profile. If you purchase a course, we collect payment information, including your billing address and payment method. For tutors registering to sell courses, additional details such as professional qualifications and teaching experience may be required.

Additionally, we automatically collect information about your interactions with our platform. This includes your IP address, browser type, operating system, device information, and usage patterns such as pages visited, time spent on the platform, and actions taken. This data helps us understand user behavior, improve our services, and ensure the platformâ€™s security.

<h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>

We use your personal information to provide, enhance, and personalize our services. Specifically, we use your data to create and maintain your account, process transactions, and communicate with you regarding your activities on the platform. For example, we send confirmation emails for course purchases or updates about new features relevant to your interests.

Your information also enables us to improve our platform by analyzing user trends and preferences. By studying your interactions, we refine our course offerings, website design, and customer support. Additionally, we may use your data to send you promotional content, such as discounts on courses or announcements about new educational resources, but only with your consent where required by law.

Ensuring the safety and security of our platform is another critical use of your information. We employ data monitoring systems to detect and prevent fraud, unauthorized access, and other malicious activities. Your data also helps us comply with legal obligations, such as responding to lawful requests from regulatory authorities.

<h3>Sharing Your Information</h3>

We understand the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of your information. We do not sell your personal data to third parties. However, in specific scenarios, we may share your information with trusted partners to facilitate our operations. For example, payment processors and financial institutions require access to your billing data to complete transactions securely.

In some cases, we may share your data with service providers that assist with marketing, analytics, or technical support. These providers are contractually obligated to use your information solely for the agreed purposes and must implement strict security measures.

We may also disclose your information if required by law or in response to a valid legal request, such as a court order or subpoena. Furthermore, in the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of our business, your information may be transferred to the new entity as part of the transaction.

<h3>Your Rights</h3>

As a user, you have certain rights regarding your personal data. These rights vary depending on your location but generally include the ability to access, update, and delete your information. You may request a copy of the personal data we hold about you and correct any inaccuracies. If you wish to delete your account, you can do so by contacting our support team. Please note that we may retain certain information for legal or administrative purposes.

You have the right to opt out of marketing communications at any time. To do so, simply click the "unsubscribe" link in any email we send or adjust your preferences in your account settings. Additionally, you can restrict or object to the processing of your data in specific circumstances, such as when the processing is based on legitimate interests or for direct marketing purposes.

<h3>Data Security</h3>

We take the security of your personal information seriously and implement robust measures to protect it. Our platform uses encryption technologies, secure server environments, and regular security assessments to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other risks. While we strive to maintain the highest security standards, it is essential to acknowledge that no method of data transmission over the internet is entirely secure. We encourage you to protect your account by using a strong password and safeguarding your login credentials.

<h3>Retention of Data</h3>

We retain your personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. For example, we keep your account data as long as you maintain an active account with us. Transactional data may be retained for a longer period to comply with legal obligations, such as tax regulations or dispute resolution.

If you request the deletion of your account, we will delete your personal information except where retention is required by law or for legitimate business purposes. In such cases, we ensure that the retained data is securely stored and used solely for the intended purpose.

<h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, or legal requirements. When we make significant updates, we will notify you through email or a prominent notice on our platform. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.
